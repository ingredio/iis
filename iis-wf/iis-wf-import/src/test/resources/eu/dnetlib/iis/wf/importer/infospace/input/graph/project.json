proposal seeks funding under the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2014-2015 to establish an ERA-NET for joint European research coordination on Sustainable Animal Production (SusAn). The scope for this ERA-NET has been developed under the SCAR Collaborative Working Group on Sustainable Animal Production (CWG-SAP). Funding organisations from 22 European countries initially seek to support one co-funded call followed by other joint activities including the development of a Common Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda on Sustainable Animal Production. The animal production sector forms an important part of Europeâ€™s (agricultural) economy and plays an essential role in the provision of Europe`s citizens with high quality animal products. Like other agriculture sectors, animal production faces many challenges from projected increases in global demand for food, climate change, competition for natural resources and economic volatility. The European animal production landscape is very complex, consisting of different species farmed within a wide range of different extensive, semi-intensive and intensive production systems using multiple resources to produce a diverse range of animal products and other services. Partners in this ERA-NET believe, however, that these challenges and complexities can be effectively addressed through joint European research within a framework which supports the three pillars of sustainability - economy, environment and society - and targets opportunities for innovative research spanning all areas of animal production such as health and welfare, feeding and nutrition, reproduction, breeding and genetics, housing, nutrient management and economics. Partners in ERA-NET SusAn endorse scientific excellence and recommend an integrated, interdisciplinary, cross-cutting and multi-actor approach to research and knowledge exchange which reflects the complexity of the research requirements for sustainable European animal production."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"European Research Area on Sustainable Animal Production Systems"},"totalcost":1.59838E7,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}

research in the field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has greatly advanced over the last decades, driven by the potential of OLED technology for various display applications. Yet, today, most of the commercial OLED devices contain expensive rare metals like Iridium and Platinum. An alternative promising strategy is based on the use of all-organic emitters, featuring the recently reported thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) mechanism. Relying on a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process, TADF-based OLEDs may utilize all electrically generated singlet and triplet excitons, going well beyond the 25% spin statistical bottleneck of organic electroluminescence. Nowadays, however, only a few TADF-based OLEDs have demonstrated efficiencies comparable to the best metal-organic materials. Research efforts so far have been mostly based on a trial-and-error approach in absence of a solid fundamental understanding of the underlying processes. The project MILORD aims at providing a comprehensive picture of the TADF mechanism through the use of an original multiscale modelling approach, going all the way from the molecular to the device scale. We will explore the energetics and nature of the involved excited states, describe the kinetics of competing processes, and model the diffusion and interactions of singlets and triplets in a realistic medium. The results of MILORD will provide detailed mechanistic insights into the TADF process, which will ultimately allow us to identify structure-property relationships and propose new strategies to minimize losses. By integrating the research into a large collaborative network around the Host and the Fellow, we hope that our theoretical work will guide synthetic efforts towards the discovery of a new generation of more efficient materials and device architectures."},"title":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":"Managing trIplets for fLuorescence in ORganics: Towards a predictive moDel (MILORD)"},"totalcost":172800.0,"websiteurl":{"dataInfo":{"deletedbyinference":false,"inferenceprovenance":"","inferred":false,"invisible":false,"provenanceaction":{"classid":"","classname":"","schemeid":"","schemename":""},"trust":""},"value":""}}
