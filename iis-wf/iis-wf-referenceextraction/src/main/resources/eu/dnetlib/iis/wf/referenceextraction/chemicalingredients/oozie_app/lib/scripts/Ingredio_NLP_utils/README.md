### Data Mining
* Model that can determine whether a scientific text is correlated with chemical substances found in food and cosmetics that exhibit carcinogenicity, toxicity, irritation and allergies. The model is trained on biomedical data, using multiple machine learning algorithms. 
### Named Entity Recognition
* Given a corpus of texts, that consists of abstracts and titles and are related to the food and cosmetics, extract names of compounds that are not listed in our in-house dataset.
### Causality Inference
* Given a corpus of texts, that consists of abstracts and titles from papers and has to do with chemical compounds that are related to food and cosmetics industry, determine if the compound has a positive or negative relation to several adverse effects(cancer, neurotoxicity etc).
